## Pink Salmon Rapid Adaptation Project

The goal is to compare the whole genomes of Pink salmon that were introduced into the Great Lakes with their progenitor population's
(Lakelse River, a tributary of the Skeena River). Samples are have roughly ~12X coverage / sample  and are indvidually tagged.

### Samples
134 fish total

| Site x year  | Sample number |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Lakelse odd  | 29 	       |
| Lakelse even | 30	       |
| Steel odd 2-yr | 30          |
| Steel odd 3-yr | 15          |
| Steel even 2-yr | 30         |
| Total | 134                  |
